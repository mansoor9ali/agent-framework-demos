I bought this wireless mouse last month and it's been mostly great. 
The battery life is incredible - I've only charged it once in 4 weeks. 
The ergonomic design fits my hand perfectly and the buttons are responsive.
However, the scroll wheel is a bit stiff and makes clicking sounds. 
Also, it's quite expensive compared to similar models. 
Overall, I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars.
