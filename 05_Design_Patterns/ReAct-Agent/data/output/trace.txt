Negotiations with landowners and residents on the site started in March 1989, and the redevelopment was authorised by the government in September 2017. The construction started in August 2019 and was completed in 2023. The architectural firm Pelli Clarke Pelli Architects won the contract for the exterior design of the skyscrapers, while Sou Fujimoto and Thomas Heatherwick were commissioned to design the interiors and the exteriors of the low-level structures respectively.\nThe complex lies between sister Mori Building projects Roppongi Hills to the west, Toranomon Hills to the east, and Ark Hills to the north."

Lokhandwala Minerva, also in Mumbai, with a height of 301 metres (988 feet) and 78 floors, is the tallest completed building in the country.\nSeveral taller buildings are under construction, and some are on hold. \nMumbai has the highest number of skyscrapers and high-rise buildings in India; more than 200 skyscrapers and 5,600 high-rise buildings currently exist in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.  Delhi-NCR has also witnessed a massive construction boom in the last 20 years with around 24 skyscrapers and 5,200 high-rise buildings already constructed in the region. Kolkata has 14 existing skyscrapers and around 1,000 completed high-rise buildings. Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Pune, Surat, GIFT City and Kochi also have numerous high-rise buildings."

These measurements include spires and other architectural elements but exclude antenna masts. Only habitable buildings are included in this list, thereby excluding structures such as radio masts and towers, observation towers, temples, chimneys, and other non-habitable architectural structures.\nThe development of initial skyscrapers in India began with the completion of the LIC Building in Chennai in 1959. Comprising 12 floors, it was the first skyscraper in the country and remained the tallest building in India until 1961, when it was surpassed by the 25-storey Usha Kiran Building in Mumbai. Since then, numerous taller buildings have been constructed across various cities.\nAs of May 2025, Palais Royale in Mumbai, which structurally topped out at 320 metres in 2018 but remains under construction, is the tallest building in the country. Lokhandwala Minerva, also located in Mumbai, is the tallest completed building in India, standing at 301 metres (988 feet) and 78 floors. Several taller buildings are either under construction or currently on hold.\nMumbai leads the country in vertical development, with over 250 skyscrapers and approximately 5,600 high-rise buildings within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. In southern India, Hyderabad has seen a significant construction boom in recent years, with 42 completed or topped out skyscrapers and over 120 skyscrapers under construction. The Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) has also experienced rapid urban development in its suburbs over the past two decades, featuring 28 skyscrapers and around 5,200 high-rise buildings. Kolkata has 16 existing skyscrapers and around 1,000 high-rise buildings.

  "summary": "This article ranks the tallest buildings in India that are at least 190 metres (623 ft) in height, based on standard height measurements as defined by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. These measurements include spires and other architectural elements but exclude antenna masts. Only habitable buildings are included in this list, thereby excluding structures such as radio masts and towers, observation towers, temples, chimneys, and other non-habitable architectural structures.\nThe development of initial skyscrapers in India began with the completion of the LIC Building in Chennai in 1959. Comprising 12 floors, it was the first skyscraper in the country and remained the tallest building in India until 1961, when it was surpassed by the 25-storey Usha Kiran Building in Mumbai. Since then, numerous taller buildings have been constructed across various cities.\nAs of May 2025, Palais Royale in Mumbai, which structurally topped out at 320 metres in 2018 but remains under construction, is the tallest building in the country. Lokhandwala Minerva, also located in Mumbai, is the tallest completed building in India, standing at 301 metres (988 feet) and 78 floors. Several taller buildings are either under construction or currently on hold.\nMumbai leads the country in vertical development, with over 250 skyscrapers and approximately 5,600 high-rise buildings within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. In southern India, Hyderabad has seen a significant construction boom in recent years, with 42 completed or topped out skyscrapers and over 120 skyscrapers under construction. The Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) has also experienced rapid urban development in its suburbs over the past two decades, featuring 28 skyscrapers and around 5,200 high-rise buildings. Kolkata has 16 existing skyscrapers and around 1,000 high-rise buildings. Other major cities with a notable presence of high-rise developments include Bengaluru, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Kochi, Mangaluru, Surat, and GIFT City."

The reigning champions are Argentina, who won their third title at the 2022 World Cup by defeating France.\nThe contest starts with the qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase. In the tournament phase, 32 teams compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over the course of about a month. The host nation(s) automatically qualify for the group stage of the tournament. The competition is scheduled to expand to 48 teams, starting with the 2026 World Cup.\nAs of the 2022 World Cup, 22 final tournaments have been held since the event's inception in 1930, and a total of 80 national teams have competed. The trophy has been won by eight national teams. With five wins, Brazil  is the only team to have played in every tournament. The other World Cup winners are Germany and Italy, with four titles each; Argentina, with three titles; France and inaugural winner Uruguay, each with two titles; and England and Spain, with one title each.\nThe World Cup is globally regarded as the most prestigious association football competition, as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world. The viewership of the 2018 World Cup was estimated to be 3.57 billion, close to half of the global population, while the engagement with the 2022 World Cup was estimated to be 5 billion, with about 1.5 billion people watching the final match.\nEighteen countries have hosted the World Cup, most recently Qatar, who hosted the 2022 event. The 2026 tournament will be jointly hosted by Canada, Mexico, and the United States, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups."

Bell considered his invention an intrusion on his real work as a scientist and refused to have a telephone in his study.\nMany other inventions marked Bell's later life, including ground-breaking work in optical telecommunications, hydrofoils, and aeronautics. Bell also had a strong influence on the National Geographic Society and its magazine while serving as its second president from 1898 to 1903.\nBeyond his work in engineering, Bell had a deep interest in the emerging science of heredity. His work in this area has been called \"the soundest, and most useful study of human heredity proposed in nineteenth-century America ... Bell's most notable contribution to basic science, as distinct from invention.\""

    "thought": "The Wikipedia summary for Alexander Graham Bell states that he is credited with patenting the first practical telephone and was awarded the first U.S. patent for it on March 7, 1876. The earlier summary also noted that multiple individuals were involved, but Bell is widely recognized as the primary inventor due to his patent and practical implementation. This information is sufficient to answer the query accurately, acknowledging both Bell's key role and the historical context of multiple contributors.",
    "answer": "Alexander Graham Bell is credited with inventing the telephone, having patented the first practical telephone on March 7, 1876. However, the invention involved contributions from others like Antonio Meucci, Philipp Reis, and Elisha Gray, leading to patent disputes. Bell's work is most prominently associated with the telephone's development and commercialization."
